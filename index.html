                <img src='#' >
                <p>I am a project manager with Tech background I code and network here and there<br></p>
                <p> I have a degree in Computer technology and for a while I felt like I dd not really belong in Tech and
                 I believed I was rather suited in spearheading projects and assigning tasks and being a transformative leader!
                 <br>
                 I love fitness and everyting healthy, you could call me a health junkie!
                 <br>
                 I do hope you enjoy being here and feel free to look into the projects I have done and I look forward in 
                  and enagging with you
            </p>
